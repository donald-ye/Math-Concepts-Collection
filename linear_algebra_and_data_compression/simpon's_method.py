A common feature is that by using techniques from linear algebra, one may find a very nice approximation of given data (in a very big or even infinite-dimensional vector space) in a reasonable small vector space.

In this project, we investigate how to compress continuous sound data by using finitely many numbers.

Sound data is given as a continuous function $f(x)$. If we divide the time interval into reasonably small subintervals, then on each interval, the function $f(x)$ looks like a periodic function, because the sound is a vibration that propagates as an (in general very complicated) wave of pressure and a wave is periodic. From now on, for simplicity, assume that the period of $f(x)$ is $2\pi$ and we will assume that $f \in C[-\pi, \pi]$.

On $C[-\pi, \pi]$, the following formula yields an inner product:
$$\langle g, h\rangle = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}g(x)h(x)dx.$$
Furthermore, we know that the following set is an orthonormal set.
$$\mathcal{T}_n := \{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \sin x, \cos x, \sin 2x, \cos 2x, \cdots, \sin nx, \cos nx\}$$
Let $W_n$ be the sub vector space of $C[-\pi, \pi]$ spanned by $\mathcal{T}_n$. Then for any $f \in C[-\pi, \pi]$, its best approximation in $W_n$ is given by
$$S_n(x) := \langle f(x), 1\rangle \frac{1}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^n \langle f(x), \cos kx\rangle \cos kx + \sum_{k=1}^n \langle f(x), \sin kx\rangle \sin kx.$$

##### 1. (10 pts) Construct a function **Simpson(f, m)** which evaluates the definite integral $$\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)dx$$ with $m$ intervals by using the Simpson's rule. Note that $m$ has to be an even number.
